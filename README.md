# Cafe Bill System

The Cafe Bill System is a simple command-line application written in Java. It simulates the process of ordering items from a cafe menu and calculating the total bill based on the user's selections. The system presents a menu with a few options, allows the user to choose items and specify quantities, and then calculates and displays the total bill when the user is ready.
## Features:
### Menu Display:
The system displays a menu with four options: Tea, Coffee, Milk, and Bill.

Each item in the menu is assigned a number (1 for Tea, 2 for Coffee, 3 for Milk, 4 for Bill).
### User Interaction:
The user is prompted to enter their choice from the menu.
After selecting a beverage, the user is asked to enter the quantity of the chosen item.

The user can continue to add items to their order by selecting from the menu again.
### Billing:

When the user selects the "Bill" option, the system calculates the total amount based on the quantities and prices of the selected items.

The system then displays the total bill amount and terminates the program.
